<b>Greed Dice Web game</b> (#2 Hack Club Athena Award Project)

<b>Description:</b> Second Athena Award  project. This is a website version of a dice game called "Greed" I would play in my Ap statistics class

<b>Game Rules:</b> After you roll a starting number you will have a total of 3 Rounds to get the highest Score possible.
In each round if the six dice roll a total of more than 20 you loose all your points and only keep the starting number.
You can choose to not move on to the next round and keep your score by pressing "DONE" at the end of each round.

My Highest Score is <b>126</b>

<b>DON'T WORRY IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET TO ROUND 3, IT JUST TAKES ALOT OF LUCK AND PATIENCE</b>
